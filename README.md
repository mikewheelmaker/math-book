# The "Complete" Collection of Mathematics Books: Theory and Exercises

## Who is it for?
This collection for everyone. It contains "all" of mathematics, from the simplest of subjects
to the most advanced. It is not meant to be a textbook, but rather a training tool in the journey
of discovering and expanding one's mathematical knowledge and experience.

## What is it about?
This collection of books goes through all the theory and also offers an extensive amount of exercises,
some solved and some unsolved. The solved exercises are there to consolidate the theory
and the unsolved ones are there to be solved, with the difficulty ranging from easy to difficult.
The companion answer book contains the solutions to all of the unsolved problems,
but without the complete algorithms that produced them.
At the end of each book there is a final test, which sums up everything learned in the book.

## Where to start?
Wherever you feel comfortable. If you do not have the prerequisite information to start with a certain book,
you will not be able to fully take advantage of it. If you do not know where to start, just start with the first
book and go straight to the final test. It contains one problem for each exercise type presented in the book.
Practice is never a bad thing. If you solve everything correctly, congratulations; you can proceed to the next book!
If not, you might need to revisit some theory.

## How to contribute?
This collection of books is meant to free mathematics from any costs associated with studying it.
As such, this project is completely free and available online with the original LaTeX sources and PDF files.
If you are a teacher or mathematician (amateur or professional) and you would like to contribute to
this project, you can do so in several ways:
- Send exercises via email. They will be added after a thorough review.
- Fork this repository on GitHub and create a pull request with your changes.
- Comment on the GitHub repository with your suggestions.
